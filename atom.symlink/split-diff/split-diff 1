questions:
  - question: What is GitLab High Availability?
    answer: |
      High availability is a system design that ensures a prearranged level of operational performance throughout a specific time-period. The most common way to measure HA is through the notion of uptime, which measures how long a service is up and running. <a href="/high-availability/">Learn more...</a>
  - question: Is there educational pricing?
    answer: |
      GitLab's Educational pricing is that for educational institutions, students do not count towards the user count. The purchase of at least one subscription is required.
  - question: How is GitLab EE licensed?
    answer: |
      Every person with a GitLab account that is not blocked by the administrator should be counted in the subscription.
  - question: Can I get an evaluation license of EE?
    answer: |
      It is possible to obtain a free evaluation license of our enterprise edition for a 30 day period for up to 100 users.
  - question: What will happen to my evaluation license key at the end of the trial period?
    answer: |
      When you decide to purchase a subscription, you will be issued a new license key dependent on the type of subscription you sign up for. Should you not take out a subscription, your license key will expire at the end of your evaluation period.
  - question: Can I add more users to my subscription?
    answer: |
      Yes. You have a few options. You can add users to your subscription any time during the subscription period. You can log in to your account via the
      <a href="https://customers.gitlab.com">GitLab Customer Portal</a> and add more seats or by either contacting <a href="mailto:renewals@gitlab.com">renewals@gitlab.com</a> for a quote. In either case, 
      the cost will be prorated from the date of quote/purchase through the end end of the subscription period. You may also pay for the additional licences per
      our true-up model.
  - question: The True-Up model seems complicated, can you illustrate?
    answer: |
      If you have 100 active users today, you should purchase a 100 user subscription. Suppose that when you renew next year you have 300 active users (200 extra users). When you renew you pay for a 300 user subscription and you also pay the full annual fee for the 200 users that you added during the year.
  - question: Do students have to pay or do they receive a discount?
    answer: |
      GitLab's Educational pricing is that for educational institutions, students do
      not count towards the user count. The purchase of at least one subscription is
      required.
  - question: Do non-profits have to pay for the Enterprise Edition?
    answer: |
      Non-profits can use GitLab Community edition for free but need to purchase a
      subscription to the Enterprise Edition at our published rates.
  - question: Why does GitLab use licenses?
    answer: |
      The code for Enterprise Edition is open and can be inspected by anyone. This
      makes it easier to offer a trial of Enterprise Edition.
  - question: Can anyone download GitLab EE?
    answer: |
      Yes, but it will not be functional without a license key.
  - question: How does the license key affect customers?
    answer: |
      Customers can now download and inspect the code for the latest GitLab EE version
      for free. However, they cannot use it without a valid subscription. They also
      cannot make any modification to the GitLab EE code.
  - question: Do blocked users count towards total user count?
    answer: |
      No, only _active_ users count towards total user count.
  - question: How does the license key work?
    answer: |
      The license key is a static file which, upon uploading, allows GitLab Enterprise
      Edition to run. During license upload we check that the active users on your
      GitLab Enterprise Edition instance doesn't exceed the new number of users.
      During the licensed period you may add as many users as you want. The license
      key will expire after one year for GitLab subscribers.
  - question: How do I upgrade GitLab EE to 7.11 or above?
    answer: |
      After you upgrade GitLab to EE version 7.11 and higher, GitLab EE will
      stop working without a license key. If you don't have a license key,
      please contact <sales@gitlab.com> and request a key. Once you deploy the
      key, GitLab EE will start functioning again.
  - question: What happens when my subscription is about to expire or has expired?
    answer: |
      - Starting 30 days before the subscription end date, GitLab will display a
        notice to all administrators informing them of the impending expiration.
      - On the day the subscription expires, nothing changes.
      - 14 days after the subscription has ended, GitLab will display a notice to all
        users informing them of the expiration, and pushing code and creation of
        issues and merge requests will be disabled.
  - question: Do I need an additional license if I run more than one server (e.g., for backup, high availability, failover, testing, and staging)?
    answer: |
      No, if your GitLab Enterprise Edition servers cover the same users, you can use
      the same license file for all of them.
  - question: What happens if I decide to not renew my subscription?
    answer: |
      14 days after the end of your subscription, your key will no longer work and
      GitLab Enterprise Edition will not be functional anymore. You will be able to
      downgrade to GitLab Community Edition, which is free to use.
  - question: How does GitLab deal with bug fixes?
    answer: |
      Bugs that are reported to us always have a high priority, no matter which
      subscription you have. In most instances they will be fixed in the next release
      or the release after that, which means the turnaround is one month or two.
      Severe bugs will be fixed earlier in a patch release.
